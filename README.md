# Wrangle-Analyze-WeRateDogs-Data
This project is composed of 4 DataFrames, 1 notebook that analyzes three of these DataFrames and creates one of them, and 2 reports, which can be found in both pdf and html format within the reports folder. To view the notebook, you can either follow the installation instructions of Jupyter notebooks, or directly view them on github. As for the reports, wrangle_report is a helpful aid for going through the notebook, and act_report is an analysis of the cleaned DataFrame.

In general, this project focuses on information provided by @dog_rates, a Twitter account dedicated to rating dogs.

For a sneak peek, here is the favorite and most retweeted post from the DataFrames that will be gathered, assessed, cleaned and analyzed: https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/744234799360020481/video/1
